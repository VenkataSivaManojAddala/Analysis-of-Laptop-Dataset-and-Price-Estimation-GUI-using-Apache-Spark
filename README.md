# Laptop Dataset Analysis and Price Estimation GUI using Apache Spark

Welcome to the Laptop Dataset Analysis and Price Estimation GUI project! This repository showcases an in-depth analysis of a laptop dataset using various data analysis techniques. The dataset contains detailed specifications of laptops, and this project aims to extract valuable insights from it. Additionally, a user-friendly GUI application has been developed to allow users to estimate the price of a laptop based on their desired specifications.

## Features of the Laptop Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- Company
- TypeName
- Inches
- Screen Resolution
- Cpu
- Ram
- Memory
- Gpu
- OpSys
- Weight
- Price
- Year
- No. of sales

## Analysis on the Laptop Dataset

The analysis includes various aspects, such as:

- Estimating the projected revenue of a company
- Identifying the highest number of sales for a laptop model within a brand
- Estimating the cost breakdown of laptop components
- Calculating the maximum and minimum cost of a product from a brand in a given year
- Computing the average cost for each screen resolution type of a company
- Providing recommendations for investors based on the analysis results
- Core statistics for the number of sales of a company
- Estimating the current revenue of an operating system provider

## GUI Price Estimation Tool

In addition to the dataset analysis, this project also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. This GUI allows users to predict the price of a laptop based on their specified requirements, including screen size, screen resolution, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, operating system, and brand preferences.
